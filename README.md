# MalwareSampleCode

***This project is solely for educational purposes only and was submitted as a final project for a course***

The malware listed in this project was designed with the purpose of altering the appearrance of a victim Windows machine by changing making changes to the Windows Registry. In its current iteration, it is very noisy and has no covert method of transmission. Additionally, depending on the version of Windows the changes will not take effect even though the registry vales are changed.

* How the program was tested
* Its effects on various Windows virtual machines
* How it can be improved

***Project is Currently Under Construction***
